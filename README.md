# Google Calendar Package
Google Calendar package initially made for Project 78.
Now just here for future reference.

The following functionality is implemented:

*Search event by name(returns 1 event)
*Search event by name(returns multiple events if found)
*Basic event update, 1 parameter every time
*Delete event
*Print all the events in the console
*Create a new event

The client_secret.json is not active,so don't even think about it.
